** Go MVC + HTMX Server

Little mini Go server. Has a couple feautres I like:

1) Serving static files
2) Wrapper around go-chi for easy routing. You can now more directly use the idea of "controllers", with easy pathing.
3) Inadverntly fell into the MVC pattern, making things feel a bit more natural.
4) All in one front end and back end. HTMX is used to make request to the data endpoints.
5) Controllers are extensible for different types of middleware, specific to that route.
6) And finally... good old fashion Go templates of course!

WIP, but looking forward to experimenting and using this more in the future.
